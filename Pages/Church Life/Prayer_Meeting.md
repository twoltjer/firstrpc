The people of God are called to gather and pray together (Acts 2:42; 4:24-31; 1 Timothy 2:1-9). C. H. Spurgeon called the prayer meeting the engine room of the church. This is where weak impotent men pray to the omnipotent God who delights in the prayers of His children. Here we cry out to the Lord for His presence and power, holiness in our congregation, conversion of souls both local and abroad, and temporal needs all to the Glory of God. 

Our prayer meeting venue rotates in family homes.
