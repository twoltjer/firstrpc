Evangelism is the proclamation of the good news of Jesus Christ to lost sinners. Christ commands us “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature” (Mark 16:15). 

Our congregation is engaged in evangelism in a variety of ways including:

- Preaching the Gospel as part of the ordinary means of grace every Lord’s day
- The ordinary and daily witness of the saints to lost family & friends
- Jail ministry at Kent County
- Weekly open-air street evangelism in downtown Grand Rapids 

## Open-Air Evangelism

Jesus Christ says in Luke 14:21-23 “Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind… Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.” Paul in Romans 10:14-17 exhorts us, “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”

In light of this teaching we at First RP seek to reach the lost by going to where lost sinners are so that they may hear the good news of Jesus Christ. Every Tuesday 7-8:30pm (May-October) and Saturday 6-8pm (all year round) we go downtown to spread the Gospel. We set up a table with Bibles and literature, open-air preach, engage in one-on-one conversations, and pray for the city of Grand Rapids.
