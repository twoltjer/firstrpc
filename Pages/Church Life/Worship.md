You are warmly invited to our worship service! 

What is worship? Worship is the spiritual honoring of the Triune God through Jesus Christ, whereby the Christian enters the special presence of God to glorify Him by admiring, adoring, blessing, and praising Him with heart wrought faith in reverence, love, and joy.

How do we worship? Our worship is simple and Bible-based. Our worship service consists in prayer, the singing of Psalms a capella, reading and preaching of the Word, the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, collection of tithes (in a box at the door of the church), and closing with a benediction. See below for an outline of our worship,

Why do we worship this way? We do so because God has revealed in His Word that acceptable worship is by positive warrant only, that is, whatsoever is not commanded is forbidden (Deuteronomy 12:32; John 4:24). Therefore, we worship according to the regulative principle of worship. We love and fear our God, so worship Him as He wills and not according to our own will (Colossians 2:23). God’s worship, God’s way, glorifies God and not man.
